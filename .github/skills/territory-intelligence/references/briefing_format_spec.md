# Territory Intelligence Briefing Format Specification

## Structure

```markdown
# Territory Intelligence Briefing — {date}

## Book Snapshot
Table with: Accounts, ARR, GHE, CfB (attach%), whitespace, GHAS (attach%), Teams

## Priority Accounts (top 8)
### {Account} — ${ARR} ARR
- Book: GHE, CfB (attach%, 30d change), GHAS (90d change)
- Revenue: MoM trend for Copilot and/or Actions
- PRs: total/mo, Code Review %, users (if data exists)
- Engagement: contact count, best contact name/title/score/stage
- Hiring: relevant open roles (if searched)
- Action: ONE specific next step with named contact or "need contacts"

## Territory Health Metrics
- Copilot attach rate + trend + worst accounts
- GHAS attach rate + whitespace count
- Renewals next 90 days (table)
- Teams → GHE migration opportunities

## Strategic Moves
Numbered list (max 5) of highest-leverage actions, each with:
- Which accounts
- What to do
- Why now (quantified)
```

## Tone Guidelines

- Direct and blunt. "17% penetration on your LARGEST account is unacceptable."
- Every recommendation includes a number. Not "low adoption" but "2.5% of 4,299 PRs."
- Name specific people. Not "reach out to a contact" but "Call Angela Venuk (CIO)."
- Prioritize by dollar impact. Lead with the biggest ARR at risk.
